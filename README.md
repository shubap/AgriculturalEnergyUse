# AgriculturalEnergyUse
I used python packages such as pandas and matplotlib to perform exploratory data analysis and data visualization to analyze different countries' energy use as it relates to agriculture in the year 2019. 
The data comes from csv files which I obtained from the FAOSTAT, or Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database website, which shares statistical data collected and maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Here is the link to the data source: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GN. 

I chose to more closely examine this data because I am curious about how the different sources and uses of energy vary by country during a time where there is much discussion about switching to more sustainable energy sources as we work together to keep global emissions low and combat climate change. Since the FAOSTAT domain “Energy Use” contains data on the amount of energy used within the farm gate (including aquaculture) to operate machinery, heat stables, as well as to operate fishing vessels, it disseminates data on the energy activity data and the related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) which is of interest to my exploration. Through this exploration I was able to get a better sense of which countries contribute most to which gas emissions, which is a crucial step when considering how we can work together across nations to promoting more sustainable sources of energy.

To explain the structure of this project, I first carried out an initial analysis and visualization creation with Python libraries, and I then recreated the DataFrames from the Python pandas library in tables and views using SQL.
